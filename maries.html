					<h3>Role</h3>
						<p>Led design of component library and hi-fidelity mock-ups, data visualizations, grid and typescale. Collaborated on wireframing and information architecture redesign.</p>
					<h3>Intent</h3>
						<h4 class="callout">Provide scalable solutions to a growing bakery.</h4>
							<p>Marie&#8217s is a small and rapidly expanding bakery in Wathena, near Kansas City, that offers gluten-free items both in store and in partner stores across the greater Kansas City area. The bakery needed a simplified shopping experience, a more robust tool to document orders and performance and a brand system to move quickly into the future.</p>
					<h3>Final Designs</h3>
						<h4>Hi-fis</h4>
							<p>Below are a few of the high fidelity interfaces I made for Marie&#8217s. It was imperative that this software be accessible on both the mobile and tablet for our users, so content and mobile accessibility were high priorities.</p>
							<p>Currently, I am polishing the interface, specifically around color contrast and other points of accessibility, and will be making changes over the month of July.</p>

						<h4>Style Guide + Component Library</h4>
							<p>As a whole, the previous design lacked clarity in the user experience and consistency in the visual system. Too many interactions mixed with too much content created an overwhelming and under-delivering experience. From a visual standpoint, all sides of the tool needed to be reconsidered. I developed a style guideline and library, including a typescale and flexible grid system, new palette, UI and custom iconography. Below are a few mock ups of the tool and website, providing a glimpse into the way the individual elements came together.</p>

					<h3>Process</h3>
					<h4>Personas</h4>
						<h4 class="callout">Understanding users&#8217 needs and use cases</h4>
							<p>The project extended to multiple users with unique needs. These users were categorized into three groups: shoppe personas, wholesale personas and retail personas.</p>
					<h5>Shoppe Personas</h5>
						<p>Within the bakery, shoppe personas completed business tasks such as creating and editing invoices, creating and managing reports, products, store hours and setting revenue goals. In addition, product-focused baking tasks such as preparing and packaging products, managing the ingredients list, recipes, and larger orders.</p>
					<h5>Wholesale Personas</h5>
						<p>In the grocery or vending store space, wholesale personas needed to conduct tasks such as purchasing products, managing accounts, assisting customer purchases, paying for invoices, advertising and maintaining supplier relationships.</p>
					<h5>Retail Personas</h5>
						<p>Also in the store space, the retail personas needed to be able to place and purchase larger orders and deliver them locally and remotely.</p>
					<h4>Information Architecture</h4>
						<p>The site architecture underwent a significant number of changes. Thinking about both the retail-facing and the shoppe and wholesale facing site as one allowed us to identify different flows and needs for the greater experience. We thought about how our personas would navigate the site in order to accomplish their goals. We thought about the micro interactions different users would complete to sign on, complete an order or see their profile. To read more about the process of updating the ia, take a look at my <a href="https://k8mash.wordpress.com/2016/01/07/updating-the-site-arch-maries/" target="_blank">site ia</a> post.</p>
					<h4>Wireframing + Ideation</h4>
						<p>Once additions and updates to the ia were <a href="https://k8mash.wordpress.com/2015/12/12/kick-off-to-maries-redesign/" target="_blank">identified</a>, wireframing new and improved experiences was the next focus. While some just needed updates, such as the menu, ordering/shopping experience and check out, other pages and user flows were completely new. The cake builder, goal setter, dashboard, recipe maker and individual profile required a lot of ideation. Below are some sketches of my process.</p>
