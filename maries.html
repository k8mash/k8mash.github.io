					<h3>Role</h3>
					<p>Led data visualizations, design of component library and hi-fidelity mock-ups, grid and typescale. Collaborated on wireframing, and information architecture redesign.</p>
					<h3>Work<h3>
					<h4>Provide scalable solutions to a growing bakery.</h4>
					<p>Marieâ€™s is a small and rapidly expanding bakery in Wathena, Kansas-City, that offers gluten-free items both in store, and in partner stores across the greater Kansas-City area. The bakery needed a simplified shopping experience, a more robust tool to document orders and performance, and a brand system to move forward with, fast.</p>
					
					<h3>Omni-channel Ecosystem</h3>
					<h4>Understanding users’ needs and use cases</h4>
					<p>The project extended to multiple users with unique needs. These users were categorized into three groups: shoppe personas, wholesale personas, and retail personas.</p>
					
					<h5>Wholesale Personas</h5>
						<ul>
							<li>The Store Buyer, responsible for purchasing products, managing accounts, and assisting customer purchases.</li>
							<li>The Store Owner, responsible for paying for invoices, advertising, and maintaining supplier relationships.</li>
						</ul>
					<h5>Retail Personas</h5>
						<ul>
							<li>The Gluten-free wholesale buyer, looking to purchase larger quantities from wholesaler.</li>
							<li>The Gluten-free retail buyer, looking for gluten free products at smaller scale, such as cakes, etc. Places order to pick up at shoppe.</li>
							<li>The Gluten-free Retail Buyer.....</li>
						</ul>
					<p>Below is a diagram that identifies the greater system the personas operate within.</p>

								<h5>Retail-facing site</h5>
									<p>Excess pages and content were cut and reorganized for a concise, mobile-first experience.</p>
									<p>The shopping cart experience and menu were redesigned, and a custom cake-builder tool was created to streamline and digitize the manual ordering process. To see the updated site, check it out here.</p>
								<h5>Shoppe + Wholesale Site</h5>
									<p>Initial wireframing and interactive prototype testing highlighted the importance of this software in our users’ day to day lives. For the bakers and delivery personnel, this tool would be used constantly throughout their days. It became clear that notifications or up-to-date alerts would be needed. Additional modifications included a customizable dashboard, updated table system, and ingredient/recipe entry to provide more accurate data entry and insight into company, vendor, and product performance.</p>

						<h4>Style Guide + Component Library</h4>
							<p>As a whole, the previous design lacked clarity in the user experience and consistency in the visual system. Too many interactions mixed with too much content created an overwhelming and under delivering experience. From a visual standpoint, all sides of the tool needed to be reconsidered. A typescale and flexible grid system were introduced, as well as a new palette and UI.</p>
						<h4>Usability & Accessibility</h4>
						<h4>Take Aways</h4>
