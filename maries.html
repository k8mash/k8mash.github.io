					<h3>Role</h3>
					<p>Led design of component library and hi-fidelity mock-ups, data visualizations, grid and typescale. Collaborated on wireframing, and information architecture redesign.</p>
					<h3>Intent</h3>
					<h4>Provide scalable solutions to a growing bakery.</h4>
					<p>Marie's is a small and rapidly expanding bakery in Wathena, Kansas-City, that offers gluten-free items both in store, and in partner stores across the greater Kansas-City area. The bakery needed a simplified shopping experience, a more robust tool to document orders and performance, and a brand system to move forward with, fast.</p>

					<h3>Personas</h3>
					<h4>Understanding usersâ€™ needs and use cases</h4>
					<p>The project extended to multiple users with unique needs. These users were categorized into three groups: shoppe personas, wholesale personas, and retail personas.</p>
					
					<h5>Shoppe Personas</h5>
						<p>Within the bakery, shoppe personas completed business tasks such as creating and editing invoices, creating and managing reports, products, store hours, and setting revenue goals. In addition, product focused baking tasks such as preparing and packaging products, managing the ingredients list, recipes, and larger orders.  
					<h5>Wholesale Personas</h5>
						<p>In the grocery or vending store space, wholesale personas needed to conduct tasks such as purchasing products, managing accounts, assisting customer purchases, paying for invoices, advertising, and maintaining supplier relationships.</p>
					<h5>Retail Personas</h5>
						<p>Also in the store space, the retail personas needed to be able to place and purchase larger orders and deliver them locally and remotely.</p>
					<h3>Site Information Architecture</h3>

						<p>The site architecture underwent a lot of changes. Thinking about both the retail-facing and the shoppe and wholesale facing site as one allowed us to identify different flows and needs for the greater experience. We thought about how our personas would navigate the site in order to accomplish their goals. We thought about the micro interactions different users would complete, to sign on, complete an order, or see their profile. To read more about the process of updating the ia, take a look at my <a href="">site ia</a> post.</p>

					<h3>Wireframing + Ideation</h3>
						<p>Once additions and updates to the ia were identified, wireframing new and improved experiences was the next focus. While some just needed updates, such as the menu, ordering/shopping experience, and check out, other pages and user flows were completely new. The cake builder, goal setter, dashboard, recipe maker, and individual profile required a lot of ideation. Below are some sketches of my process.</p>

							<p>Early on, we met with our stakeholders to conduct think alouds and task-based user testing. You can see our first prototype here, and read about our process and findings in my <a href="">user testing</a> post.</p>
						<h3>Style Guide + Component Library</h3>
							<p>As a whole, the previous design lacked clarity in the user experience and consistency in the visual system. Too many interactions mixed with too much content created an overwhelming and under delivering experience. From a visual standpoint, all sides of the tool and website needed to be reconsidered. I developed two style guides and libraries, one for the shoppe and whole sale site, and one for the retail-facing site. For both, a typescale and flexible grid system, new palette, UI and custom iconography were included in the library. Below are a few mock ups of the tool and website, where you can see the individual elements come together.</p>

							<h3>Status Update</h3>
								<p>The site update is currently being developed and is ____% complete. User testing will occur again once development is complete. Currently I am working to finish the component library, including accessibility and empty state designs. We hope to have the site live by the end of July, 2016.
