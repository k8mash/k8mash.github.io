					<h3>Role</h3>

					<h3>Work<h3>
					<h4>Providing scalable solutions to a growing bakery.</h4>
					<p>Marie’s is a small but rapidly expanding bakery in Wathena, Kansas-City, that offers gluten-free items both in store, and in partner stores across the greater Kansas-City area. Over the course of the past two months, Marie’s has increased their partnerships by ____ percent.</p>
					
					<h3>Success Metrics</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Brand that builds on past, to further recognition and elevates products.</li>
						<li>Shopping experience that clearly communicates baker’s services, skills, and streamlines ordering process for both vendors and consumers.</li>
						<li>An administrator experience that provides deeper and actionable insights to inform future strategy.</li>
					</ul>

					<h4>Tooling Experience</h4>
						<p>To provide the best experience for both the consumer, vendor, and admin, a restructure of the information architecture was needed.</p>
						<p>On the consumer side, content was cut (___pages) and reorganized for a more concise, mobile-friendly experience. The shopping cart and menu were redesigned, and a custom cake-builder tool was created to streamline and digitize the manual ordering process. </p>
						<p>The greatest amount of change and update, however, was to the administrator side of the software. Initial wireframing and interactive prototype testing highlighted the importance of this tool in our users’ day to day lives. For the bakers and delivery personnel, this tool would be used constantly. It became clear that notifications or up-to-date alerts would be needed.</p>
						<p>On the administrator side, a customizable dashboard, updated table system, and ingredient/recipe entry were added to provide more accurate data entry and insight into company, vendor, and product performance.</p>
						<p>As a whole, previous experience lacked hierarchy in both the user experience and visual system. Too many interactions mixed with too much content created an overwhelming and under delivering experience. From a visual standpoint, all sides of the tool needed to be completely reconsidered.  A typescale and flexible grid system were introduced, in addition to two palettes, one for the shopping and one for the software side.</p>
					<h4>Brand</h4>
					<p>Marie’s Gluten-Free takes inspiration not only from Dauphine of France, but from the 18th-century, a time of both extravagance and change. Pulling from this time period, I drafted up a moodboard bridging this time period with today.<p>
						<img src="m_moodboard">
					<p>Before coming onto the team, Marie’s had an established identity, and was frequently selling out in stores. With a faithful customer and growing consumer base, the goal was to push the brand forward, increase brand recognition, _____.</p>
						<img src="old_image">
					<p>Marie’s delights customers when they learn just how friendly these baked goods and mixes are to their dietary restrictions. Despite this, however, the founder frequently received questions around the allergy-friendliness of her products. To provide assurance and continue to delight the customer, the mark needed to be both playful and authoritative. To accomplish this I pulled in strong geometric shapes to update the silhouette and a serif type that brought structure and a classic feel.<p>

					<h4>Retrospective</h4>
					<p>Currently my team and I are working to deliver these experiences by the end of March 2016. This role has provided greater insight into project management, back-end capabilities and limitations, and flexible branding.<p>
