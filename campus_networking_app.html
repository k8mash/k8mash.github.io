			<h3>Research</h3>
			<h4>Exploratory: Problem Space + Background</h4>
				<p>In the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, WBCSD, Vision 2050 report, they published a comprehensive list of changes over the next ___ years to reach a more sustainable, desirable food future.</p>
				<p class="title">Defining the Problem Space:</p><p>Human Needs + opportunity space:
				I broke down humanâ€™s basic needs to see where they were being met and where potential opportunities lied.</p>
				<p class="title">Opportunity Space:</p><p>The perception of success/prosperity and its tie to consumption and materialistic pursuits. The greatest opportunity for change lied in education and the redefining of this human need.</p>

			<h3>Refinement</h3>
				<p class="title">Natural literacy: the organic learning that happens through experiences in our world.<br>Service learning: a combination of community service and real world experience that allow students to cain and learn applicable skills relevant to their future work and selves.</p>
				<h4>Service learning allows individuals to broaden their understanding and sense of self through the context of others.</h4>
				<p>Thinking at scale, the greatest chance for change lied in large, concentrated groups of people. With this and a short runway for this project in mind, I framed the issue in the academic context of Carnegie Mellon University. While this initial research could have influenced many different routes, this decision provided framing for the solution and provided access to the users.</p>

			<h3>Users: College Students, Faculty and Community members</h3>
				<p>The communities surrounding educational spaces were the ideal demographic and target group due to their large concentrations across the country, and openness to ideas/learning and new experiences.</p>
				<h4>Archetypes</h4>
					<ul class = "archetypes">
						<li><p class ="title">The Connector</p><p>Actively looking to deeply connect with current community and establish and grow networks</p>
						</li>
						<li><p class ="title">The Learner</p><p>Wants to discover more about place, their community, their university, their student body</p>
						</li>
						<li><p class ="title">The Activator</p><p>Promotes participation in community, creates and partakes in events, opportunities, etc.</p>

			<h3>Concept: Service Learning Curriculum</h3>
				<h4>A product that harbors collaboration, learning, and diversity. Allowing users to connect, plan, and document their impact.</h4>
				<p>Students pursue a degree, engage with the community, and develop a greater sense of self and the world. With the support from Faculty and community members, this new education option at CMU would provide a more interconnected community.</p>
