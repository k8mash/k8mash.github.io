				<h3>Role</h3>
					<p>In addition to my work on the practices content, I participated and led projects to contribute to the IBM Austin Studio Culture and greater IBM Design initiative. </p>
				<h3>Work</h3>
					<p>The design initiative at IBM is quite impressive and quite an undertaking. Over the past ____ years, IBM has successfully hired and acquired _____ designers, planning to reach 2,000 this year. The goal of this initiative is to bring design thinking and user-centered design into the core of all IBM products and teams. With so many designers, and over 400,000 IBMers world wide, this initiative has many challenges, the most significant being scale. The goal of these projects was to maintain and scale a culture of design across IBM corporate campuses, and to studios and offices around the world.</p>

			<h3>IBM Austin Studios Wayfinding Update</h3>
			<p>As IBM Studios Austin expanded in both space and employees, there was a need to improve the wayfinding system. ___ percent of new designers had difficulty orienting themselves and after a year, ____ percent ________. To improve the experience and ease of use for our designers and visitors, I conducted research and led the redesign of a signage system, that build off current regions and landmarks to unite the multiple floors of the studio. Below are the directional, stairwell, and room signs. Illustrations were included to provide texture and build off the IBM heritage that was carried throughout the studio and room naming system.</p>

			<h3>IBM Studios Austin: Guide to Everything</h3>
				<p>As mentioned above, over the past 4 years, IBM has been hiring a ton of designers. To help with on boarding and answer questions about IBM Design, the office, and the culture/ values of “studioers” a guidebook was developed. I worked closely with my team to develop the content, look and feel, and final book to be delivered to new hires before their respective start dates. This edition was made specifically for the Austin Studio, however in the future, the goal is for each studio to customize and produce their own for their studioer population. </p>
			<h3>Event Installations</h3> 
				<p>IBM Studios Austin is the headquarters and birthplace of the IBM design initiative. Because of this, during my time at IBM we hosted events for both internal and external visitors. I had the opportunity to help with Ginny Rometty, Chairman and CEO, and Robert LeBlanc, VP IBM Cloud, talks and visits to the Austin Studio. For each event, I designed the backdrops, themed based on the topic of the event.</p>
