					<h3>Role</h3>
					<p>Led brand redesign, packaging and illustrations. Assisted in user testing.</p>
					<h3>Intent</h3>
					<p>Before joining the team, Marie's had an established identity and was frequently selling out in stores. With a faithful customer and growing consumer base, the goal was to push the brand forward, increase brand recognition and elevate the product.</p>
					<h3>Branding Update</h3>
						<h4 class ="callout">Charming, darling and youthful</h4>
							<p>Marie’s brand guidelines offer flexibility and consistency across multiple channels.</p>
						<h4>Logo</h4>

						<h4>Type</h4>
							<p>Marie’s uses _____ and ____. The mixture of the serif and san serif create a classic and modern feeling in both the packaging and web experience.</p>
						<h4>Color</h4>
							<p>Marie’s uses two palettes: one for its retail-facing site and another for its packaging.</p>
							<h4>Web</h4>
								<p>mariesglutenfree.com is the master brand and home to Marie Antoinette’s Gluten Free Bake Shoppe. A palette of reds, pinks, and creams communicates Marie’s charm and product space, baked goods. (need to add more, may be changing some of it…)</p>
							<h4>Packaging</h4>
							<img src="images/marie/colorpalette_complementary.jpg" class="full_image" alt="Image of the seven different packaging stickers and the palettes.">
							<img src="images/marie/colorpalette.jpg" class="full_image" alt="Color palette: green, reds, magentas, pinks, purples, browns, and yellows.">
								<p>Each category has a distinct color. Three different palettes were presented, including a monochrome, a complimentary and a rainbow combination. The complimentary palette was chosen due to its flexibility for future or additional categories. While a departure from the site palette, these bright monochromatic colors will stand out on shelves.</p>
								<p>Final documentation of the packaging and stickers is still on my to-do list; however, some of the <a href="https://k8mash.wordpress.com/2016/06/12/maries-packaging-prototypes/">final protoypes</a> can be seen on my blog. </p>
					<h3>Process</h4>
						<h4>Look and Feel</h4>
							<p>Marie’s Gluten-Free takes inspiration not only from Dauphine of France, but from the 18th-century, a time of both extravagance and change. Pulling from this time period, I drafted a moodboard bridging this time period with today.</p>
								<img src="images/marie/moodboard.jpg" class="full_image" alt="moodboard for look and feel of product.">
						<h4>Logo</h4>
							<p>Strong geometric shapes update the silhouette and a serif type that brought structure and a classic feel. To see the before and after for the logo, check out my blog <a href="">post</a>.<p>
								<img src="images/marie/logo_process.jpg" class="full_image" alt="Logo iterations, four logos featuring portait of a woman.">
						<h4>Packaging</h4>
							<p>Marie’s delights customers when they learn just how friendly the baked goods and mixes are to their dietary restrictions. Despite this, however, the founder frequently received questions around the allergy-friendliness of her products. To provide assurance and continue to delight  customers, the packaging needed to be clear, but also communicate the brand attributes.</p>
							<h4>Testing</h4>
								<p>To test and validate the logo and layout, we surveyed a group of 100 potential customers with celiac disease in the midwest. Four different designs were tested, including the original to gauge audience preferences. We found that buyers' ages impacted their design preferences, and that our hunch — which was the need to develop new packaging to better compete in the current market —  was validated.</p>

						<p>Based on the survey, I developed a stronger hierarchy, first emphasizing the specific type of product. The second task was to balance the logo with the name of the product. Finding just the right design proved to be challenging. Marie's currently carries seven categories of baked goods: cupcakes, muffins, breads, pies, cookies, other sweets and mixes. Each package needed to provide information about the individual product, its category, nutrition, branding and ingredient list. With so much information, (there are over ____ different types of cupcakes), a clear system needed to be created that could scale in the case of additional products.</p>
						<p>To contrast and complement the logo, and allow for flexibility and independence from photography, illustrations were integrated into the system. A subtle stripe pattern was also incorporated to relate back to the business's inspiration.</p>
						<p>The <a href="https://k8mash.wordpress.com/2016/02/16/competitive-analysis-packaging-expedition/">materials for the packaging</a> and current trends were considered as well. Trips to the grocery allowed us to see what was currently on the market, what was working and what could be improved. For this first stage, we decided to keep the current packing materials (boxes, bags, clam-shells, etc.) the bakery currently was using.</p>
	
					<h3>Retrospective</h3>
						<p>I am excited and hopeful for Marie's future. I hope this rebranding allows Marie's to continue to grow and allow the owner to reach her goal of expansion. This project was an iceberg. A logo and packaging design seemed simple enough, however, once the product list, packaging regulations, etc. came into play this project became much more complex. Working through it took time, organization and communication, and was well worth the effort.</p>
