					<h3>Role</h3>
					<p>Led brand redesign, packaging, and illustrations. Assisted in user testing.</p>
					<h3>Intent</h3>
					<h4>Some Call out here</h4>
					<p>Before joining the team, Marie's had an established identity and was frequently selling out in stores. With a faithful customer and growing consumer base, the goal was to push the brand forward, increase brand recognition, and elevate the product. </p>
					<h3>Branding Update</h3>
						<h4>Look and Feel</h4>
							<p>Marie’s Gluten-Free takes inspiration not only from Dauphine of France, but from the 18th-century, a time of both extravagance and change. Pulling from this time period, I drafted up a moodboard bridging this time period with today.</p>
								<img src="images/marie/moodboard.jpg" class="full_image" alt="moodboard for look and feel of product.">
						<h4>Logo</h4>
							<p>The brand attributes included:_______.  To accomplish this I pulled in strong geometric shapes to update the silhouette and a serif type that brought structure and a classic feel.<p>

						<h4>Packaging</h4>
							<p>Marie’s delights customers when they learn just how friendly the baked goods and mixes are to their dietary restrictions. Despite this, however, the founder frequently received questions around the allergy-friendliness of her products. To provide assurance and continue to delight the customer, the packaging needed to be clear, but also communicate the brand attributes.</p>
							<p>To contrast and compliment the logo, and allow for flexibility and independence from photography, illustrations were integrated into the system. A subtle stripe pattern was incorporated as well, to relate back to the business's inspiration.</p>

							<h5>Testing</h5>
								<p>To test and validate the logo and layout, we surveyed a group of 100 potential customers with celiac disease in the midwest. Four different designs were tested, including the original to gauge audience preferences. We found that buyers' ages impact their design preferences, and that our hunch, to compete in the current market the packaging needed a new look, was validated.</p>

								<p>Based off the survey, I decided to develop a stronger heirarchy, emphasising the specific type of product first and foremost. The second task was to balance the logo with the name of the product. Finding just the right design proved to be challenging. Marie's currently carries seven categories of baked goods: cupcakes, muffins, breads, pies, cookies, other sweets, and mixes. Each package needed to provide information about the individual product, its category, nutrition, branding, and ingredient list. With so much information, (there are over ____ different types of cupcakes) a clear system needed to be created, that could scale in the case of additional products.</p>

					<h3>Final Design</h3>
						<p>Each category has a distinct color. Three different palettes were presented, a monochrome, a complimentary and a rainbow combination. The complimentary palette was chosen, due to its flexibility for future or additional categories.</p>
					<h3>Retrospective</h3>
						<p>I am very excited and hopeful for Marie's future. I hope that this rebranding allows Marie's to continue to grow, and allow the owner to reach her goal of national vending and _____. This project was an iceberg. A logo and packaging design seemed simple enough, however, once the product list, packaging regulations, etc. came into play this project became much more complex. Working through it took time, organization, communication, and was well worth the effort. </p>
