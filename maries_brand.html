					<h3>Role</h3>
					<p>Led brand, packaging, and illustrations.</p>
					<h3>Work<h3>
					<h4>Provide scalable solutions to a growing bakery.</h4>
					<p>Marie’s is a small and rapidly expanding bakery in Wathena, Kansas-City, that offers gluten-free items both in store, and in partner stores across the greater Kansas-City area. The bakery needed a simplified shopping experience, a more robust tool to document orders and performance, and a brand system to move forward with, fast.</p>
					
					<h3>Omni-channel Ecosystem</h3>
					<h4>Understanding users’ needs and use cases</h4>
					<p>The project extended to multiple users with unique needs. These users were categorized into three groups: shoppe personas, wholesale personas, and retail personas.</p>

						<h4>Branding Update</h4>
							<h5>Logo</h5>
								<p>Before coming onto the team, Marie’s had an established identity, and was frequently selling out in stores. With a faithful customer and growing consumer base, the goal was to push the brand forward, increase brand recognition, and elevate the product.  Brand attributes included:_______.  To accomplish this I pulled in strong geometric shapes to update the silhouette and a serif type that brought structure and a classic feel.<p>

							<h5>Look and Feel</h5>
								<p>Marie’s Gluten-Free takes inspiration not only from Dauphine of France, but from the 18th-century, a time of both extravagance and change. Pulling from this time period, I drafted up a moodboard bridging this time period with today.</p>
								<img src="images/marie/moodboard.jpg" class="full_image" alt="moodboard for look and feel of product.">
								<p>To contrast and compliment the logo, and allow for flexibility and independence from photography, illustrations were integrated into the system.</p>

						<h4>Packaging</h4>
							<p>Marie’s delights customers when they learn just how friendly the baked goods and mixes are to their dietary restrictions. Despite this, however, the founder frequently received questions around the allergy-friendliness of her products. To provide assurance and continue to delight the customer, the packaging needed to be clear, but also communicate the brand attributes.</p>
